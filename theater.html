    <h1>Sridhar Cheppala does chekov tonight</h1>
    <h2>The Cherry Orchard - Anton Checkov</h2>
    <p>
        [A room which is still called the nursery. One of the doors leads into
ANYA'S room. It is close on sunrise. It is May. The cherry-trees are
in flower but it is chilly in the garden. There is an early frost.
The windows of the room are shut. DUNYASHA comes in with a candle, and
LOPAKHIN with a book in his hand.]

LOPAKHIN. The train's arrived, thank God. What's the time?

DUNYASHA. It will soon be two. [Blows out candle] It is light already.

LOPAKHIN. How much was the train late? Two hours at least. [Yawns and
stretches himself] I have made a rotten mess of it! I came here on
purpose to meet them at the station, and then overslept myself... in my
chair. It's a pity. I wish you'd wakened me.

DUNYASHA. I thought you'd gone away. [Listening] I think I hear them
coming.

LOPAKHIN. [Listens] No.... They've got to collect their luggage and so
on.... [Pause] Lubov Andreyevna has been living abroad for five years;
I don't know what she'll be like now.... She's a good sort--an easy,
simple person. I remember when I was a boy of fifteen, my father, who
is dead--he used to keep a shop in the village here--hit me on the face
with his fist, and my nose bled.... We had gone into the yard together
for something or other, and he was a little drunk. Lubov Andreyevna, as
I remember her now, was still young, and very thin, and she took me to
the washstand here in this very room, the nursery. She said, "Don't
cry, little man, it'll be all right in time for your wedding." [Pause]
"Little man".... My father was a peasant, it's true, but here I am in a
white waistcoat and yellow shoes... a pearl out of an oyster. I'm rich
now, with lots of money, but just think about it and examine me, and
you'll find I'm still a peasant down to the marrow of my bones. [Turns
over the pages of his book] Here I've been reading this book, but I
understood nothing. I read and fell asleep. [Pause.]

DUNYASHA. The dogs didn't sleep all night; they know that they're
coming.

LOPAKHIN. What's up with you, Dunyasha...?
